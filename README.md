This is a repo for designing and organising a workshop in Oxford to help train & engage the neuroscience community in practices that can make our research more reproducible!

A list of everyone who has contributed so far can be found [here](./attribution.md).

FYI if your in Oxford in September there's also going to be a series of talks open about reproducibility. It's not open to the public yet but feel free to email or message me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/alex__morley) if you'd like to come.

## Pitch
This workshop will provide a practical introduction to reproducible research practices and their application within neuroscience. It’s key aims are **outreach** - exposing more scientists to the key concepts in reproducible research, **training** - providing basic training in one of those concepts, and **longevity** -to introduce resources for further learning. The workshop will thus be split into two parts - a set of talks in the morning, and breakout workshops in the afternoon.

### Talks
The first part will consist of a set of talks from leaders in their fields introducing and discussing a few key concepts such as the current issues with reproducibility in neuroscience, open publication, reproducible analysis workflows and using open data platforms. These talks will highlight not only why changes in current practice are necessary but also how they can be directly beneficial to the scientists who take part.

### Workshops
The second will be a set of break-out workshops that provide basic training in one particular area. Example workshop titles include “Git & Github: how to organise and share your code.”, “Best practices in scientific programming” and “Open-data: how, when and where to share your data”. While some new resources may be created for these workshops they will primarily consist of existing work that has been adapted to make it accessible and relevant to a neuroscience audience. Finally, they will be collated along with video recordings of the talks and hosted together in a publicly accessible repository/website.
