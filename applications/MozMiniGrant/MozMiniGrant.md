### Proposal summary

**Title** *(10 words)*: Reproducible Neuroscience Research Workshop Oxford

**Provide a brief description of your project or event**

A workshop that provides an introduction to, and basic training in, a few key areas of reproducible neuroscience research. The morning of the workshop will consist of talks from a few researchers who have lead the way in making their research reproducible showcasing how they have implemented, and benefited from, those reproducible research practices. The afternoon will consist of some breakout workshops that give a more in-depth introduction to how people can implement these practices in their research.


**Total proposal budget in US Dollars (USD)**:

$4000

**How much money in USD are you requesting from the Mozilla Foundation?**

$4000

**List your partners, if any, and the role/s they will play.** *(250 words)*

Matthew South, a software engineer at the Oxford centre for Human Brain Activity and trainee Software-Carpentry instructor, will be helping with the breakout workshops and providing his expertise in human-based research. The proposed workshop has the support of the both the UK (INCF) Neuroinformatics node (our contact here is Dr Stephen Eglen) -who will help reach out to putative speakers and the neuroinformatics community, and the Reproducible Research Oxford project who will help with planning the event and publicising it within Oxford. Further organisational support, if required, may be provided by my host organisation (the MRC Brain Network Dynamics Unit, Univsersity of Oxford).

### Proposal description

**Describe the issue/problem you are trying to address.** *(100 words)*

Many funding bodies and journals are currently, or are on the verge of, taking measures to improve the reproducibility and generalisability of neuroscience research such as requiring scientists to share their code and/or data. However many scientists feel that they do not yet have the skills or time to enact these policies. The core aims of this workshop are to persuade scientists that training in these skills is time well-invested and showcase how this training can be made accessible to all who need it. Empowering a community of neuro-biologists to share their data gives their experiments the chance to have a greater impact, and provides invaluable resources for neuro-informaticians. The repository created at the end of the course will answer the question “How do I get started with making my neuroscience more reproducible?”. This, we believe, is where there is currently a gap in training resources, and the one we aim to fill. 

**List key project activities (what you will do), outputs (what will be produced through your activities) and outcomes (impact of your project on your beneficiaries during the grant period).** *(1000 words)*

*Activities*    This workshop will provide a practical introduction to reproducible research practices and their application within neuroscience. It’s key aims are outreach - exposing more scientists to the key concepts in reproducible research, training - providing basic training in one of those concepts, and longevity -to introduce resources for further learning. The workshop will thus be split into two parts. The first part will consist of a set of talks from leaders in their fields introducing and discussing a few key concepts such as the current issues with reproducibility in neuroscience, open publication, reproducible analysis workflows and using open data platforms. These talks will highlight not only why changes in current practice are necessary but also how they can be directly beneficial to the scientists who take part. 

The second will be a set of break-out workshops that provide basic training in one particular area. Example workshop titles include “Git & Github: how to organise and share your code.”, “Best practices in scientific programming” and “Open-data: how, when and where to share your data”.

*Outputs*   While some new resources may be created for these workshops they will primarily consist of existing work that has been adapted to make it accessible and relevant to a neuroscience audience. Finally, they will be collated along with video recordings of the talks and hosted together in a publicly accessible repository/website.


*Learning Outcomes*

- Reproducible Research: Why can’t we just carry on as we were?
- Open Data: What is is Open Data and why is it beneficial? Can I share my data and how should I do it? Finding & using other people’s data.
- Code Sharing & Version Control: What is version control and why should I use it? How does git work? (Why) should I share my code on Github?
- Best practices in Scientific Programming: Making your code readable. Stacks and workspaces.
- What pre-prints and registered reports can do for reproducibility.


**Provide key indicators you plan to use to measure project outcomes and source of data.** *(500 words)*

Pre-workshop and post-workshop surveys will aim to assess change in both attitudes towards, and skills in, the aspects of reproducible research that have been presented. These survey's will be availiable on the github repo soon and will, where possible, reuse questions & measure from previously completed questionaires such that we can compare our data to a global baseline. We will also have the analytics from workshop site -which will contain all of the materials & video's from the workshop. 

**Explain who will benefit from the project.** *(100 words)*
Not only will the researchers who attend the workshop gain invaluable skills but the wider neuroscience community will then benifit from both the resources that the workshop generates directly as well as all of the output that the attendees (and resource users) have now been empowered to share.

**List any risks or challenges that may affect the overall success of your project and now how Mozilla and/or others can help you to overcome these challenges.** *(250 words)*

I think the the primary challenge associated with running this workshop will be persuading enough people to take a day out of their busy research schedules and attend the event. The main way we hope to avoid this is by personnally connecting with a few people in each of the neuroscience centres around oxford to make sure the event has enough exposure, as well as ensuring there is a "save the date" for the event sufficiently far in advance. Another possible avenue to ensure good attendence could involve asking for a small deposit (e.g. £10) to attend the event.

**Is this a new project or continuation? If new, please describe your qualifications to initiate the activity. If continued, please describe your accomplishments to date. Feel free to include links to articles and documents online that highlight your recent work.** *(1000 words)*

This is a new project. I am currently a DPhil Student in Neuroscience and have a good knowledge of both the current leaders in making their neuroscience reproducible as well as the key issues in reproducible research in general. The issue is one I am passionate about and so there is no question that I am motivated enough to make sure the event succeeds. Recently I have completed the training to become a Software-Carpentry instructor and through this, and hundreds of hours of teaching experience, have developed a good understanding of how people learn. While my event-organising experience is currently limited to some small events I ran as the co-ordinator of a student charity I will have substantial support to drawn upon in this area from my partners and, being accutely aware of this inexperience, I will be particularly careful to get the support I need from them, and from others in the community who I know who have run these type of events.

**Mozilla works in the open. How will you document and share your project progress with the community.** *(250 words)*

The entire project, including this application, has been written in the open in a github repository.

All speakers will be required to share their slides and all materials for workshop will be openly licensed (or will be using material from openly licensed sources).

I will be writing posts and promoting the project on twitter as soon as we are sure that we will have funding!

**How will you continue work on this project beyond the funding period?** *(250 words)*

The breakout workshop sessions can, if there is demand, provide a basis for future "study groups" based on those topics. If this is the case then we can provide the space for organising and holding any study groups that stem from this event. Furthermore the workshop itself can serve as a template for similar workshops in other institutions. If the workshop is funded I will commit to maintaining the site, and repository, on which the workshop will be based, for at least two further years.
